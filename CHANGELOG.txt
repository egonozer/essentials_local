## Version 2.2 ##

essentials.pl
  - Combine counts from both insertion site flanks prior to loess normalization and other downstream steps
  - Fixed bug where 'ta_XX.wiggle' files would turn negative loess-adjusted counts to positive. Instead stops with warning message if negative counts are encountered  
  - Default library size (-l/--libsize) set to '0', i.e. no site filtering
  - Include pool names in targets files so edgeR can include these in PCA & MDS plots
  - Remove smoothing (--smooth) from listed Essentials options. The newer versions of edgeR no longer require this value for calculation of prior degrees of freedom. 
  - Remove no repeat (--norepeat) option as this no longer has any function 
edgeR.R
  - Removed prior.df calculation for dispersion estimates. Per edgeR documentation, prior.df is automatically calcuated by the estimateDisp function.
  - Added percent variance explained to axis labels in PCA plots
  - Output pool names in PCA and MDS plots instead of pool numbers
loess.R
  - Perform outlier removal (+/- 3x IQR) prior to loess normalization
  - Outputs .png files for each counts file showing raw read counts, loess smooth line, and loess-adjusted read counts
loess_genes.R
  - Perform outlier removal (+/- 3x IQR) and removal of 0 counts prior to loess normalization
  - Outputs .png files for each gene_counts file showing per-gene read counts, loess smooth line, and loess-adjusted read counts


## Version 2.1 ##

essentials.pl
- Fixed bug where Archive::Zip module still needed to be installed, even if the --zip option was not used
- Removed remaining calls to "general::error" and replaced them with "die" statements
- Removed genome.ptt filtering and sorting steps (now handled in rewritten gbk2pttfna3.pl)
gbk2pttfna3.pl
- Rewritten to remove BioPerl dependency and to
- Now produces correctly sorted and filtered .ptt file
